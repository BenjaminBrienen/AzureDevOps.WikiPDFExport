## üèé Quickstart
This tool exports a Azure DevOps wiki as PDF. Therefore, you need to git clone the target wiki to a computer. You can get the clone link of the wiki in the top right of the wiki homepage:
![Clone a wiki](images/CloneWiki.png)

To clone this wiki, use the following command:
`git clone https://dev.azure.com/mmelcher/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/_git/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport.wiki`

The result should look like this: 
![Cloned wiki repository](images/Clone.png)
 
Once you have cloned the wiki, you must download the Azure DevOps WikiPDFExport tool.
**[azuredevops-export-wiki.exe](https://github.com/MaxMelcher/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/releases)** (~20MB)

You can drop it right into the cloned folder and execute it there. 
Launched without parameters, the tool will detect all wiki files next to it and convert it to a PDF called export.pdf right next to it. Similar to this [pdf](https://github.com/MaxMelcher/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/blob/main/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/export.pdf).

If you need more control over the output, please see the Configuration Options below or by launching the tool with --help parameter.

## üí™ Features

The tool currently supports the following:
* Export all wiki pages (and sub pages) in the correct order including styles and formatting.
* Includes pictures (remote and relative urls)
* Creates PDF bookmarks to all pages for easier navigation within the PDF
* If you link to other wiki pages, the link in the PDF will work, too. 
* Everything self-contained. Download the .exe file, run it, done.
* Tool can be used as part of a build, see [BuildTask](AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/Build-Task.md)
* Supports emoticons :) ‚ö† ‚Ñπ
* It is fast. A PDF with 160 pages is created in less than a second. 1000 pages in ~8 seconds.

## üõ∞ Requirements

The tool is developed as .NET 5 application, therefore you need to have the runtime installed. Download is available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
Currently it requires a x64 runtime.

## üò≤ Limitations

So far the following limitations are known:
* TOC (Table of Contents) tag is not supported and removed from the pdf.
* The tool, sometimes shows an error "Qt: Could not initialize OLE (error 80010106)" - this can be ignored.
* If headers are not formatted properly (#Header instead of # Header), they are rendered incorrectly. I might fix that in the future.
* The tool lacks proper testing because I only have two realistic wikis available. Want to contribute one?

## ‚öñ License
See [license](/AzureDevOps.WikiPDFExport/License.md)

## üéØ Telemetry
The tool uses Application Insights for basic telemetry:
- The duration of the export and the count of wiki pages is tracked and submitted to Azure. 
- In the case of an error, the exception is submitted. 
- No wiki data/content is submitted.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Some pages are missing? 
Please check the .order files in your wiki if the pages are listed in there.

### The emoticons are missing in the PDF? 
Please check if you have page file that are encoded (e.g. Test%20dFiles.md)

### There is an error 'Qt: Could not initialize OLE (error 80010106)'. 
Yes, please ignore for now.

## ‚ô• Thanks

In this tool uses open source libraries that do the actual work - I just combined them to get the export as PDF:
1. [CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) to parse the command line
1. [MarkDig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig/) to parse markdown files to HTML.
1. [DinkToPdf](https://github.com/rdvojmoc/DinkToPdf) to export HTML to PDF
1. [dotnet-warp](https://github.com/Hubert-Rybak/dotnet-warp) to release a self-contained exe file
1. [puppeteer-sharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) to convert mermaid markdown to SVG
